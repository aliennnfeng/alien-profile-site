# Xiya Feng — VC Profile Site: Design Proposal

## Information architecture (single-page)

| Section | ID | Purpose |
|--------|----|--------|
| **Hero / Landing** | `#hero` | Name context (domain), positioning statement, primary CTAs, key metrics |
| **About Me** | `#about` | Who you are, value props (Strategic Vision, Deep Analysis, Founder-First) |
| **Experience** | `#experience` | Professional journey, timeline + role cards with achievements |
| **Investing Focus** | `#investing-focus` | Sectors/themes you invest in or are interested in |
| **Industry Insights** | `#industry-insights` | Optional: writing, thinking, or interests (concise) |
| **Contact** | `#contact` | LinkedIn, email, “get in touch” |

- **Navigation:** All menubar items are anchor links within `index.html` (no second page).
- **Resume:** Use resume content to ground copy, dates, company names, and metrics. Replace placeholder numbers (e.g. 25+ portfolio companies, 10+ years) with real figures.

## Visual direction

- **Theme:** Dark, near-black background with subtle grid and soft orange/gold particles.
- **Palette:** Black/dark grey base, white/light grey text, orange/gold (`#e8a54b`) for accents (logo, headings, icons, buttons, metrics).
- **Typography:** Strong hierarchy; DM Sans (or similar) for a clean, modern VC/startup feel. Accent color on one key word per headline (e.g. “Investing”, “Innovation”, “Journey”).
- **Layout:** Minimalist, generous whitespace, centered hero and section content; cards for metrics, value props, experience, and focus areas.
- **Components:** Fixed header with logo + nav; gradient primary CTA, outlined secondary CTA; timeline dots + experience cards; icon + label for section headers.

## Tone guidelines for copy

- **Professional but not corporate:** Confident, direct, no jargon or filler.
- **Sharp and modern:** Short sentences; concrete outcomes (e.g. “$200M+ follow-on”, “50+ founders mentored”).
- **Not academic:** Avoid theoretical or essay-like intros; lead with role, impact, and sectors.
- **Not traditional finance:** No banker/consultant clichés; focus on venture, founders, and early-stage.
- **Credible and forward-looking:** Use numbers and specifics; frame as “what I do” and “what I look for” rather than generic claims.

## Presenting VC-related experience (concise & credible)

1. **Lead with role + firm + timeframe** (e.g. Senior Investment Analyst, Innovative Ventures, 2020–Present).
2. **One short paragraph** on scope: deal flow, sectors, stage, and types of work (due diligence, board support, etc.).
3. **Key Achievements** as 3–5 bullet points: outcomes only (e.g. portfolio companies raised $XM, valuation growth, number of deals, exits, founders supported). Use real numbers from the resume.
4. **Metrics strip (hero):** 3 headline stats (e.g. portfolio companies, sectors, years) that match the resume and signal depth without clutter.
5. **Investing Focus:** Short sector/thematic cards (e.g. AI/ML, Fintech, Sustainable Tech) so recruiters and founders see fit quickly.
6. **Industry Insights:** Optional; keep to a few titles + links or one-liners. Only include if it strengthens the narrative (e.g. scout, operator, or thought-leadership angle).
